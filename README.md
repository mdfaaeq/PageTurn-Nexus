# Client-Server
 The Bookstore REST API is a Java-based backend system developed using the JAX-RS/Jersey framework to support an online bookstore platform. It manages five core entities—Books, Authors, Customers, Shopping Carts, and Orders—via standardized HTTP endpoints. The API enables full inventory control and relationship tracking between books and authors, supports user registration with validation for emails and passwords, facilitates cart operations with stock checks, and handles order finalization along with purchase history tracking. It incorporates comprehensive error handling through exception mappers for meaningful HTTP responses. Although it currently utilizes in-memory storage via a Database utility class, its modular architecture is designed for seamless integration with persistent storage solutions.
